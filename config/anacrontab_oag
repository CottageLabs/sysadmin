# s3cmd, part of the backup script, is not going to find its config file at /home/cloo/.s3cfg if run directly as root
# and to be fair, other things may break too - scripts get developed as cloo, so just run them as cloo
# better for security / reliability too, in case a script is buggy

# replicate old functionality of just keep 1 daily backup by using -g and a filename without a timestamp,
# but should write some rotation scripts soon and enable keeping more backups by just removing the -g param below
