Log files generally follow this pattern:
    Most recent: <log filename>
    The one before: <log filename>.0
    Even older ones: <log filename>.*.gz (increasing numbers denote older logs, e.g. <log filename>.1.gz is more recent than <log filename>.2.gz)

Use

    zcat <log filename>.<number>.gz | less

(or | grep -i "suspicious activity").
to decompress logs for viewing on the fly.

NOTE: The firewall we use, ufw, puts things in the kernel log and the syslog. If you don't care about those events, make sure to always

    grep -v "UFW BLOCK" <log filename>

when reading these logs

List of useful log files:

    /var/log/dmesg  # stamped log of events from boot of system to now, mostly hardware stuff
    /var/log/syslog  # the system log, may contain big parts of dmesg
                     # and hardware stuff, but will also have firewall
                     # block events and other info. Many programs will 
                     # output to this when they don't know what else to
                     # do (if they have permissions).
    /var/log/kern.log  # the big kernel log, anything kernel-related, firewall events and hardware messages
    /var/log/mcelog  # decoded hardware errors information .. if mcelog works (it's a bit outdated and doesn't work well with Ubuntu)
    /var/log/nginx/access.log  # all requests served by nginx
    /var/log/nginx/error.log  # all requests server by nginx which resulted in errors, e.g. 502 Bad Gateway when your app is broken!
    /var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log  # the log of the master supervisord process
    /var/log/supervisor/*-error.log  # the output of applications seems to get logged to the error logs, not the normal logs
    /var/log/supervisor/*-access.log  # seems to log explicit print statements in web application code. STDOUT, basically.
